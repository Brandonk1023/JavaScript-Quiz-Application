# <JavaScrip-Quiz-Application>

## Description

This project was created to provide a JavaScript basics quiz that could be used for studying.  The quiz is browser based allowing it to be used easily, without an extra installation process.  This would allow for easy access to study materials.  In creating this project I was able to learn more about web API's, and the process of creating interactive time based quizzes.
